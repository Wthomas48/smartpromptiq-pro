I'm building SmartPromptIQ Academy with a dual monetization strategy:

CONTEXT:
- Part 1: Free in-app academy for SmartPromptIQ customers (drives retention & product mastery)
- Part 2: Paid standalone learning platform (generates revenue from external learners)

BUSINESS MODEL:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Customer Type    │ Access Level      │ Pricing              │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ SmartPromptIQ    │ Free Core Tracks  │ Included with sub    │
│ Subscribers      │ + Product Masters │                      │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ External         │ Freemium Model    │ $0-299/course        │
│ Learners         │ Free: Basics      │ $49/month Pro access │
│                  │ Paid: Advanced    │ $299 Certification   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:

Phase 1: Enhanced Database Schema
================================
Add to the previous schema:

1. **Monetization Tables**:
   - `course_pricing` (id, course_id, price_tier, price_usd, currency, is_active)
   - `enrollments` (id, user_id, course_id, enrollment_type, paid_amount, payment_id, enrolled_at, expires_at)
   - `subscription_plans` (id, plan_name, price_monthly, price_annual, features_json, is_active)
   - `user_subscriptions` (id, user_id, plan_id, status, starts_at, ends_at, stripe_subscription_id)
   - `payment_transactions` (id, user_id, amount, currency, payment_provider, transaction_id, status, created_at)

2. **Content Access Control**:
   - `course_access_rules` (id, course_id, required_subscription_level, requires_smartpromptiq_account)
   - `content_gates` (id, lesson_id, gate_type, unlock_condition)

3. **Marketing & Analytics**:
   - `referral_codes` (id, code, user_id, discount_percent, uses_remaining, created_at)
   - `course_reviews` (id, user_id, course_id, rating, review_text, is_verified_purchase, created_at)
   - `learning_analytics` (id, user_id, course_id, time_spent, completion_rate, quiz_avg_score, last_activity)
   - `marketing_campaigns` (id, campaign_name, target_audience, discount_code, conversion_tracking)

Phase 2: Dual-Mode Architecture
================================
Create two entry points with shared core:

1. **In-App Academy Route** (`/academy/*`):
   - Automatically authenticate SmartPromptIQ users
   - Grant access to all "Product Training" tracks
   - Show personalized learning paths based on user's SmartPromptIQ usage
   - No payment flow needed
   - Emphasize "Learn to use SmartPromptIQ better"

2. **Standalone Platform** (`/learn/*` or `learn.smartpromptiq.com`):
   - Public-facing marketing site
   - Separate authentication (or unified SSO)
   - Payment gateway integration
   - Course marketplace UI
   - Emphasize "Master Prompt Engineering"
   - SEO-optimized landing pages

3. **Shared Components**:
   - Same lesson viewer, prompt lab, quiz engine
   - Unified progress tracking
   - Cross-platform certificates
   - Shared content library with different access rules

Phase 3: Course Catalog Structure

2. **Payment Components**:
   - Pricing page with tier comparison
